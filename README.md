# Logistic-Regression-Classifier
Part of the Data Scinece Bootcamp training material. I wrote it as an illustration of simple logistic-regression classifier algorithm implementation.
There are two implemented algorithms:
 - Iterative log-reg classifier
 - Vector log-reg classifier  
 
 In both implementation an accuracy comparison with [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) log-reg and LDA classifiers was conducted.
